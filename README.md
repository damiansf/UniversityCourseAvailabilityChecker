# UniversityCourseAvailabilityChecker

Simple messy python script that polls webadvisor (University of Guelph's course selection system) for you to get course availabilities. A notification sound is played when a course has open spots. This script helps automate the process of waiting for spots to open up in courses.


* NOTE, If you choose to attempt to use this script for malicious purposes to spam the University with requests I do not take any responsibility for your actions nor do I condone them.
